      download them to my armour\u2019s system. The cyborgs were the result of underground
      usturian organizations\u2019 experiments on bionic enhancements. To avoid a
      scandal in Ustur, they had them escape to Earth so they could be eliminated
      here, with Ustur society none the wiser."

      fi les of yours. Perhaps enough to take legal action against the ones covering
